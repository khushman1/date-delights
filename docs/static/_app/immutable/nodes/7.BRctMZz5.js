Here's what to look for when selecting dates:</p> <article class="quality-tip svelte-1y3xh7a"><h3 class="svelte-1y3xh7a">Appearance</h3> <p class="svelte-1y3xh7a">Good quality dates should have a plump, glossy appearance and consistent color for their type. Avoid dates that look overly dry, shriveled, or have sugar crystals on the surface (unless it's intentional for certain types).</p></article> <article class="quality-tip svelte-1y3xh7a"><h3 class="svelte-1y3xh7a">Texture</h3> <p class="svelte-1y3xh7a">The texture varies depending on the type of date, but generally, they should be soft and slightly yielding to the touch, not hard or rock-solid.  They should also not be overly sticky or mushy, which can indicate spoilage.</p></article> <article class="quality-tip svelte-1y3xh7a"><h3 class="svelte-1y3xh7a">Smell</h3> <p class="svelte-1y3xh7a">Fresh, high-quality dates should have a mild, sweet, and fruity aroma characteristic of dates. Avoid dates that have a fermented, sour, or off-putting smell, as this is a sign of spoilage.</p></article> <article class="quality-tip svelte-1y3xh7a"><h3 class="svelte-1y3xh7a">Packaging and Source</h3> <p class="svelte-1y3xh7a">If buying packaged dates, check for airtight packaging to ensure freshness.  Consider purchasing dates from reputable sources or brands that prioritize quality and proper storage.  Knowing the origin can sometimes also indicate quality, as certain regions are renowned for specific date varieties.</p></article></section></main>`);function Q(m){var l=$();j(q=>{var D=A();_.title="Know Your Dates: Types and Quality - Date Delights",f(q,D)});var n=t(e(l),2),o=t(e(n),4),y=t(e(o),2),x=e(y);i(x,"src",`${r??""}/medjool-dates.jpg`),a(y),s(4),a(o);var h=t(o,2),d=t(e(h),2),w=e(d);i(w,"src",`${r??""}/deglet-noor-dates.jpg`),a(d),s(4),a(h);var c=t(h,2),v=t(e(c),2),b=e(v);i(b,"src",`${r??""}/barhi-dates.jpg`),a(v),s(4),a(c);var p=t(c,2),u=t(e(p),2),k=e(u);i(k,"src",`${r??""}/ajwa-dates.jpg`),a(u),s(4),a(p),a(n),s(2),a(l),T(3,l,()=>K,()=>({duration:500})),f(m,l)}export{Q as component};
